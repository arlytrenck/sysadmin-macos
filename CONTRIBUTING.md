# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a small, personal collection
of sysadmin scripts and docs, kept simple on purpose: contributions are
welcome but should fit that spirit.

## Reporting a bug or suggesting a change

Open an issue describing:
- What script or doc is affected.
- What you expected vs. what actually happened (for a script, include the
  macOS version and shell version if relevant).
- Any error output.

## Submitting a change

1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your change.
2. Keep changes focused. One script/doc per pull request is easier to
   review than a bundle of unrelated fixes.
3. For scripts:
   - Match the existing style: a `#`-comment header block (the script
     name and a one-line purpose, then `Usage:`, `Options:`, and
     `Exit codes:` sections), options parsed with `getopts`, and a `-h`
     option. The `-h` handler calls the standard one-line `usage()`
     helper, which reprints that header block:
     `usage() { sed -n '2,/^[^#]/p' "$0" | sed '1{/^#$/d;}; $d; s/^# \{0,1\}//'; exit "${1:-0}"; }`
   - Scripts should fail safely. Prefer erroring out over guessing, and
     avoid destructive actions without a clear opt-in flag.
   - Target macOS's built-in Bash 3.2 unless a script has a specific
     reason to require newer Bash — note that requirement clearly if so.
   - Run `shellcheck` locally before submitting: CI runs the same check
     (`severity: warning`) plus a `bash -n` parse of every script.
4. For docs:
   - Keep the same tone: practical, concrete commands over abstract
     advice. Prefer real command examples to prose descriptions.
   - Note any assumptions (elevated privileges required, specific macOS
     version, etc.).
5. Update the relevant README's file listing if you add a new script or
   doc.

## What's out of scope

- Anything that requires a specific commercial product or vendor-specific
  API to be useful to most readers.
- Scripts that make destructive changes with no dry-run or confirmation
  option.
- Content that only makes sense for one very specific environment rather
  than general system administration.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive in issues and pull requests. Disagreement
about approach is fine and expected; personal attacks are not.
